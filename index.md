### CPSC 120
* Lab 6 
I really liked lab 6 part 1. It was a random sandwich generator which I thought was just a funny lab. It was cool to see how random generators were coded and how they worked the point of this lab was us to get used to vectors and strings. I also learned how to code things like how to make sure the right amount of arguments were being typed in and making sure there was 3.
* Lab 4 
For Lab 4 part it was a number guesser and it was my first experience with a game like which was really nice i got to see how those worked and it was fun to code and it was like a little game.It was a simple game of just having one player put in the number and store it into the computer. Then the 2nd player will guess and the terminal will give them hints.
* Lab 9
Lab 9 part 1 was a spell checker and we got the words from another file and it made sure the words were spelled right and telling us how many spelling errors we had I was interested in how those worked so it was nice to see I learned about how to access another file like the dictionary. I always knew about that but it was nice to figure that out and to do that.
