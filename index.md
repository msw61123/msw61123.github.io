### CPSC 120
* Lab 6 

I really liked lab 6 part 1. It was a random sandwich generator which I thought was just a fun lab. It was cool to see how random generators were coded and how they worked. The point of this lab was for us to get used to vectors and strings. I also learned how to make sure the right amount of arguments were being typed in and making sure there was 3.
* Lab 4 

For Lab 4 part 1 it was a number guesser and it was my first experience with something game like, which was really nice I got to see how guessers worked, and it was fun to code and it was similar to a little game.It was a simple game of just having one player put in a number and store it into the computer. Then the 2nd player will guess and the terminal will give them hints untill they guess it correct 
* Lab 9

Lab 9 part 1 was a spell checker,we obtained  the words from another file and it made sure the words were spelled right as well as telling us how many spelling errors we had. I was interested in how those worked so it was nice to see I also learned about how to access another file like the dictionary. I always knew that you could do that but it was nice to figure how to do that.
