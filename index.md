My name is Matthew Wang and im a freshman at Cal State fullerton 

I really liked lab 6 part 1. It was a random sandwich generator which I thought was just a funny lab. It was cool to see how random 
enerators were coded and how they worked the point of this lab was us to get used to vectors and strings

For Lab 4 part it was a number guesser and it was my first experience with a game like which was really nice i got to see how those 
worked and it was fun to code and it was like a little game. It was also intresting seeing how the variables would work and how to 
code if the number was less or more then the varible.

Lab 9 was a spell checker and we got the words from another file and it made sure the words were spelled right and telling us how many
spelling errors we had and checked them with a dictionary I was interested in how those worked so it was nice to see I learned about 
how to have the computer open other files in this case it was alot of words.
