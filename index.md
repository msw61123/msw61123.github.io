y name is Matthew Wang im a freshman computer sceinence student at Cal State Fullerton
I really liked lab 6 part 1. It was a random sandwich generator which I thought was just a funny lab. It was cool to see how random generators were coded and how they worked the point of this lab was us to get used to vectors and strings
For Lab 4 part it was a number guesser and it was my first experience with a game like which was really nice i got to see how those worked and it was fun to code and it was like a little game
Lab 9 was a spell checker and we got the words from another file and it made sure the words were spelled right and telling us how many spelling errors we had I was interested in how those worked so it was nice to see I learned about how to access another file like the dictionary
